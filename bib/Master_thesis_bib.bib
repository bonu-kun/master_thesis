abstract = {There are several supervised machine learning methods used for the application of automated morphological classification of galaxies; however, there has not yet been a clear comparison of these different methods using imaging data, or a investigation for maximising their effectiveness. We carry out a comparison between several common machine learning methods for galaxy classification (Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), K-nearest neighbour, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Neural Networks) by using Dark Energy Survey (DES) data combined with visual classifications from the Galaxy Zoo 1 project (GZ1). Our goal is to determine the optimal machine learning methods when using imaging data for galaxy classification. We show that CNN is the most successful method of these ten methods in our study. Using a sample of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}2,800 galaxies with visual classification from GZ1, we reach an accuracy of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}0.99 for the morphological classification of Ellipticals and Spirals. The further investigation of the galaxies that have a different ML and visual classification but with high predicted probabilities in our CNN usually reveals an the incorrect classification provided by GZ1. We further find the galaxies having a low probability of being either spirals or ellipticals are visually Lenticulars (S0), demonstrating that supervised learning is able to rediscover that this class of galaxy is distinct from both Es and Spirals. We confirm that {\$}\backslashsim{\$}2.5$\backslash${\%} galaxies are misclassified by GZ1 in our study. After correcting these galaxies' labels, we improve our CNN performance to an average accuracy of over 0.99 (accuracy of 0.994 is our best result).},
annote = {銀河の自動形態分類に用いられる教師あり機械学習法はいくつかありますが、画像データを用いたこれらの異なる手法の明確な比較や、その効果を最大限に引き出すための調査はまだ行われていません。本研究では、銀河分類のための一般的な機械学習手法（畳み込みニューラルネットワーク（CNN）、K-nearest neighbor、ロジスティック回帰、サポートベクターマシン、ランダムフォレスト、ニューラルネットワーク）を、ダークエネルギーサーベイ（DES）データとGalaxy Zoo 1プロジェクト（GZ1）による視覚的分類を組み合わせて比較しました。我々の目的は、銀河の分類に画像データを使用する際に、最適な機械学習手法を決定することです。今回の研究では、これら10種類の手法の中で、CNNが最も成功した手法であることを示しました。また、GZ1で得られた約2,800個の銀河の視覚的分類を用いて、楕円体と渦巻き体の形態分類を行ったところ、約0.99の精度が得られました。MLと視覚的分類が異なるが、CNNの予測確率が高い銀河をさらに調査すると、GZ1の分類が間違っていることがわかります。さらに、渦巻き型と楕円型に分類される確率が低い銀河は、視覚的にはレンズ状銀河(S0)であることがわかり、このクラスの銀河がEsや渦巻き型とは異なることを、教師付き学習によって再発見できたことになります。今回の研究では、GZ1によって約2.5％の銀河が誤って分類されていることを確認しました。これらの銀河のラベルを修正したところ、CNNの性能は平均0.99以上に向上しました(0.994が最良の結果です)。},

abstract = {In order to understand the formation and subsequent evolution of galaxies one must first distinguish between the two main morphological classes of massive systems: spirals and early-type systems. This paper introduces a project, Galaxy Zoo, which provides visual morphological classifications for nearly one million galaxies, extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This achievement was made possible by inviting the general public to visually inspect and classify these galaxies via the internet. The project has obtained more than 4 × 107 individual classifications made by ∼10 5 participants. We discuss the motivation and strategy for this project, and detail how the classifications were performed and processed. We find that Galaxy Zoo results are consistent with those for subsets of SDSS galaxies classified by professional astronomers, thus demonstrating that our data provide a robust morphological catalogue. Obtaining morphologies by direct visual inspection avoids introducing biases associated with proxies for morphology such as colour, concentration or structural parameters. In addition, this catalogue can be used to directly compare SDSS morphologies with older data sets. The colour-magnitude diagrams for each morphological class are shown, and we illustrate how these distributions differ from those inferred using colour alone as a proxy for morphology. {\textcopyright} 2008 RAS.},

abstract = {This paper describes the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), marking the completion of the original goals of the SDSS and the end of the phase known as SDSS-II. It includes 11,663deg2 of imaging data, with most of the 2000deg2 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120° long, 25 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap, with some regions covered by as many as 90individual imaging runs. We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly 2mag fainter than the main survey over 250deg2. The survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380deg2; the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was present in previous data releases. There are over 1.6million spectra in total, including 930,000galaxies, 120,000quasars, and 460,000stars. The data release includes improved stellar photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all been recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog, reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45milliarcseconds per coordinate. We further quantify a systematic error in bright galaxy photometry due to poor sky determination; this problem is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies. Finally, we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions, including better flat fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end, better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines, and an improved determination of stellar metallicities. {\textcopyright} 2009.

abstract = {We analyse the relationships between galaxy morphology, colour, environment and stellar mass using data for over 10 5 objects from Galaxy Zoo, the largest sample of visually classified morphologies yet compiled. We conclusively show that colour and morphology fractions are very different functions of environment. Both colour and morphology are sensitive to stellar mass. However, at fixed stellar mass, while colour is also highly sensitive to environment, morphology displays much weaker environmental trends. Only a small part of both the morphology-density and colour-density relations can be attributed to the variation in the stellar-mass function with environment. Galaxies with high stellar masses are mostly red in all environments and irrespective of their morphology. Low stellar-mass galaxies are mostly blue in low-density environments, but mostly red in high-density environments, again irrespective of their morphology. While galaxies with early-type morphology do always have higher red fractions, this is subdominant compared to the dependence of red fraction on stellar mass and environment. The colour-density relation is primarily driven by variations in colour fractions at fixed morphology, in particular the fraction of spiral galaxies that have red colours, and especially at low stellar masses. We demonstrate that our red spirals primarily include galaxies with true spiral morphology, and that they constitute an additional population to the S0 galaxies considered by previous studies. We clearly show there is an environmental dependence for colour beyond that for morphology. The environmental transformation of galaxies from blue to red must occur on significantly shorter time-scales than the transformation from spiral to early-type. We also present many of our results as functions of the distance to the nearest galaxy group. This confirms that the environmental trends we present are not specific to the manner in which environment is quantified, but nevertheless provides plain evidence for an environmental process at work in groups. However, the properties of group members show little dependence on the total mass of the group they inhabit, at least for group masses. Before using the Galaxy Zoo morphologies to produce the above results, we first quantify a luminosity-, size- and redshift-dependent classification bias that affects this data set, and probably most other studies of galaxy population morphology. A correction for this bias is derived and applied to produce a sample of galaxies with reliable morphological-type likelihoods, on which we base our analysis. {\textcopyright} 2009 RAS.},

abstract = {The monochromatic illumination system is constructed to carry out in situ measurements of the response function of the mosaicked CCD imager used in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The system is outlined and the results of the measurements, mostly during the first six years of the SDSS, are described. We present the reference response functions for the five color passbands derived from these measurements, and discuss column-to-column variations and variations in time, and also their effects on photometry. We also discuss the effect arising from various, slightly different response functions of the associated detector systems that were used to give SDSS photometry. We show that the calibration procedures of SDSS remove these variations reasonably well with the resulting final errors from variant response functions being unlikely to be larger than 0.01 mag for g, r, i, and z bands over the entire duration of the survey. The considerable aging effect is uncovered in the u band, the response function showing a 30{\%} decrease in the throughput in the short wavelength side during the survey years, which potentially causes a systematic error in photometry. The aging effect is consistent with variation of the instrumental sensitivity in the u band, which is calibrated out. The expected color variation is consistent with measured color variation in the catalog of repeated photometry. The color variation is $\Delta$(u - g) ∼ 0.01 for most stars, and at most $\Delta$(u - g) ∼ 0.02 mag for those with extreme colors. We verified in the final catalog that no systematic variations in excess of 0.01 mag are detected in the photometry which can be ascribed to aging and/or seasonal effects except for the secular u - g color variation for stars with extreme colors. {\textcopyright} 2010.

The large number of images available in current surveys makes visual inspection of each galaxy impractical for individual astronomers. GZ2 uses classifications from volunteer citizen scientists to measure morphologies for all galaxies in the DR7 Legacy survey with mr {\textgreater} 17, in addition to deeper images from SDSS Stripe 82. While the original GZ2 project identified galaxies as early-types, late-types or mergers, GZ2 measures finer morphological features. These include bars, bulges and the shapes of edge-on disks, as well as quantifying the relative strengths of galactic bulges and spiral arms. This paper presents the full public data release for the project, including measures of accuracy and bias. The majority ({\{}greater-than or approximate{\}}90 per cent) of GZ2 classifications agree with those made by professional astronomers, especially for morphological T-types, strong bars and arm curvature.
